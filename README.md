# Vincent Chu

Product & engineering leader in SaaS. Tinkerer and builder of privacy-first apps.

I started coding as a kid and still build outside of work. Lately I’ve focused on iOS and Mac apps with React Native, leaning into on-device AI and ML so they work offline and keep data private.

## Current focus (2023–present)
- **[Read Aloud EBook](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/read-aloud-ebook/id6748571026)**: turn ebooks into audiobooks with local LLM summaries.
- **[CJExplorer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cjexplorer/id6477356973)**: OCR + computer vision for instant language lookup.
- **[Receiptopia](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/receiptopia/id6475173830)**: on-device OCR for receipt scanning and categorization.
- **[Spanish or Vanish](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/spanish-or-vanish/id6747052572)**: vocabulary game that uses computer vision to identify objects.

## AI experiments
- Built a personal [chat bot](https://chat.vincentchu.com) in Feb 2024 with React, OpenAI, Python, and Flask, trained on my resume and writing.
- Earlier explorations include an [English-to-Cantonese translation prototype](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gOyMHlz5HvYn_cCInX9zLOOe1qHeu91b#scrollTo=VbznzOeCzvL) in TensorFlow.
- Built a [digit recognition project](https://vincentchu.com/digitrecognition.html) exploring handwritten digit classification.

## Previous projects
- **[WordTile](https://github.com/chuvincent/WordTile)**: web-based word game with multi-language support.
- **[PyImageMagick-7.0.11-Docker](https://github.com/chuvincent/PyImageMagick-7.0.11-Docker)**: Docker image for a newer ImageMagick with Python.
- **[random-scripts](https://github.com/chuvincent/random-scripts)**: small scripts readers can re-use for my posts on Medium.
- **[random-thoughts](https://github.com/chuvincent/random-thoughts)**: blogging and other publications.
